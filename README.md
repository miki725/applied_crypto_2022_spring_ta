# Applied Cryptography TA Scripts

## Structure

```shell
➜ tree
.
├── Makefile
└── <problem_set>
    ├── __init__.py              # allows to import all solution function
    ├── grader
    │   ├── grade.py             # official grade script
    │   ├── test-expected.json   # expected output for official grader
    │   └── test-inputs.json     # input for official grader
    ├── example-input.json       # example input
    ├── example-output.json      # expected example output
    └── solution.py              # sample solution
```

## Requirements

* `brew install colordiff`

## Importing Solutions

All problems can be independently imported for testing directly in shell:

```python
>>> from ps1 import problem1
>>> problem1(['ff'])
['FF']
```

## Makefile Utilities

### Testing Provided Solution

```
# runs diff between example output and output
# generated by solution given example input
make <problemset>/solution-diff-example

# runs diff between test expected output and output
# generated by solution given test input
make <problemset>/solution-diff-expected

# runs the grader program on example output and output
# generated by solution given example input
make <problemset>/solution-grade-example

# runs the grader program on test expected output and output
# generated by solution given test input
make <problemset>/solution-grade-expected
```

### Testing From Clipboard

Easy way to test student submission locally is to simply copy python source
code from gradescope. Then these makefile utilities can run these tests:

```
# runs diff between example output and output
# generated by clipboard program given example input
make <problemset>/diff-example

# runs diff between test expected output and output
# generated by clipboard program given test input
make <problemset>/diff-expected

# runs the grader program on example output and output
# generated by clipboard program given example input
make <problemset>/grade-example

# runs the grader program on test expected output and output
# generated by clipboard program given test input
make <problemset>/grade-expected
```
